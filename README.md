To run the code first download the Samosa Toolbox from my GitHub. Once the toolbox is downloaded, add the path to the code approrpiately.
Use the samosa tool box dataset setup code to setup a base and a retrain dataset. To create a dataset such as the MNIST split, use the dataset_setup code in this repository. Once setup, initialize the dataset variables in the boilerplate of the init function and simply run.
